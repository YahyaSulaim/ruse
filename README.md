# Ruse 🔍


## Basic Details
### Team Name: microwave


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Yahya Sulaim - AWH Engineering College
- Member 2: Athul Raj R - AWH Engineering College

### Project Description
Ruse is an interactive murder mystery detective game where players step into the role of a detective, tasked with unraveling the truth behind a puzzling murder. By inspecting the crime scene for clues and interrogating a diverse cast of witnesses, players must carefully piece together the story and identify the killer.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world doesn’t have enough armchair detectives solving fictional crimes. Ruse aims to fix that by giving everyone the chance to be Sherlock, no prior experience needed.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With Ruse, everyone has a front-row seat to a suspenseful murder mystery. Equipped with a keen eye and sharp wit, players will navigate the drama, gather clues, and expose secrets, all from the comfort of their own screen.
